#Mini.js
Minijs is a JavaScript library as mini as possible,  with a jQuery-compatible API.

### What's included
Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:

```

├── dist/
│   ├── mini.js
│   └── mini.min.js
└── src/
    ├── core.js
    ├── event.js
    ├── fx.js
    ├── fx_methods.js
    ├── data.js
    ├── ajax.js
    ├── detect.js
    └── touch.js

```

## Custom Builds
Mini-carousel.js is powered by [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), and you can create custom builds pretty easily. First of all, you’ll need Grunt and all other dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install && bower install && grunt
```
